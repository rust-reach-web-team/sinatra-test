# Sinatra Test App

To run the app locally:
1. In your terminal, run `rake server`. This will preprocess the SASS files and save them as CSS, then run the Sinatra server.
1. Navigate to the URL listed (probably `localhost:4567`)
1. To see "French" (not really French, just an example of how we might handle other languages), navigate to `localhost:4567?lang=fr`

If you make any changes, you will need to quit the server with `Ctrl-c` and restart to see them.

There's nothing "real" here yet, just a basic Sinatra skeleton.
